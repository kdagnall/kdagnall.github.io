                                        <p>BACKGROUND: <em>Terroir</em> attempts to describe the complex influences climate, geology and geography exert on wines made in a particular region. Berryessa Gap Vineyards needed a packaging update as bright as their award-winning wines that illustrated this philosophy. The Plein Aire painting of the Berryessa Gap beautifully illustrates the location of their first vineyard and namesake, which forms the border between Napa and Yolo Counties.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: Creating labels for every shape & size of wine bottle involved a lot of measuring and a healthy amount of experimentation to discover their optimal placement and layout.</p>

                                        <p>BACKGROUND: The agrestic town of Winters, California overflows with Tempranillo each year during this three day food, wine and music festival.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: Photography or digital resources from previous Temp Fests were hard to come by, so it was neccessary to create an illustration. The abstract shapes of a wine bottle and classic guitar provide a framework for the text and visually communicate the Spanish theme.</p>

After uncovering some of the original blueprints, I reverse-scanned them to create this postmark inspired logo.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: To tie the spectacular Tudor-style architecture of this Napa Valley landmark into the logo and website design, I photographed and then vectorized ornamental details from the interior.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>ROLE: WordPress Developer & WordPress SEO </p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: YoungAdultMag.com was a media rich website made up of 5000+ unique pages. The main challenge in rebranding to Young Entertainment Magazine, was that YoungAdultMag.com was built on a custom ASPX infrastructure that does not play well with the PHP-based WordPress database. It was especially important to manually migrate, edit and reorganize past articles in order to preserve their status on the search engine results pages (SERP).</p>
<p>SOLUTIONS: Each of the following strategies made the new website better, faster, and more responsive to user’s needs and interests. When we are able to avoid complications, improve customer service, simplify work and make everyone a little bit more productive, that's when cost benefits start to accrue and your new website begins to pays for itself.<p>
<p>MOBILE FIRST RESPONSIVE DESIGN: To anyone with a smartphone in their pocket, it shouldn’t be surprising that websites are
accessed more than 50% of the time by mobile users, nor that this number has been growing steadily for years. In spite of this fact, a vast majority of digital messaging is still designed with a desktop monitor in mind and gradually degraded for smaller screen sizes. Flipping that concept on its head, Young Entertainment Magazine’s website was coded with the most vital elements optimized
for smaller screens and progressively enhanced with more content as the screen size increases. This means the new site started out fast, clean and lean and always serves only the minimum data that is able to be displayed by whatever device vistiors are using. By following the mobile first philosophy, everyone benefits by saving resources, reducing load times and from higher search engine rankings.</p>
<p>RAPID PROTOTYPING: No successful product goes to market without first being prototyped and tested. Yet most websites are still launched from a finished graphic design based on the best guesses of the client and designer, and turned over to a programmer to be implemented pixel-by-pixel.</p>
<p><em>I cannot stress enough that this is the wrong way to go about things.</em></p>
<p>Instead of going straight to Photoshop, we asked several key questions about how real people were using the site. What makes them click in the first place? What pages do they stay and read? What content persuades them to click through to the next page? All these questions need to be answered before you start spending money designing on faulty assumptions.</p>
<p>During the first week of development, I launched a development mockup of the website based around high quality content and escalated the level of detail within a digital framework. This means no level of abstraction between what you think you’re getting and the reality of your users’ experience.</p>
<p>URL REDIRECTION: The most important thing to remember about search engines is that they are constantly refining themselves, which means if one or all of the pages on your website disappear for even one minute, you run the risk of being removed from the index. If this happens, you will have to start for scratch completely, as if your brand never existed. To avoid this and other pitfalls, like past users who have bookmarked your pages, you need to map every page on your old site to it’s new location or to another appropriate landing page.</p>
<p>SEO CONTENT AUDIT: Something content-heavy websites like Young Entertainment need to perform is a content audit, the fairly tedious, but nonetheless essential, process of reading, rating, reorganizing and editing every word on your website. Imagine a giant spreadsheet version of your website and you’re not far off the mark. By far the best time for this is while you are already migrating and rebranding your website.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>ROLE: Chief Developer</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Nobody does business exactly like you do. Your competition might offer some of the same stuff, but your company was built on specific values that you strive to communicate to customers and team members every day. How do you communicate these core values, so your business stays healthy, across an organization employing thousands?</p>
                                        <p>THE IDEA: In 2014, Columbus Regional Health decided to step up their game and make sure that every employee of their hospitals understood the core values that enabled their growth into West Georgia’s largest health care provider. In a proactive move, they started a conversation about the best way to launch an internal social networking website where each employee could deepen their understanding of what it means to be a leader. That’s how the “Simply Better Leadership” network was born...</p>
                                        <p>THE SOLUTION: At the heart of Simply Better Leadership are Columbus’ core values: Attitude, Commitment, Enthusiasm, Innovation & Teamwork, “ACE-IT” for short. On the website, their entire staff has access to an individual profile with book groups & discussion topics covering the Competencies, Management Skills and Behaviors an ACE-IT leader exhibits.</p>
                                        <p>We identified and customized the BuddyPress plugin for WordPress as the ultimate social networking solution for sparking dialogue and managing internal communications in a safe, HIPAA-compliant environment. Once the site was launched, Content Creators went to work interviewing Columbus’ employees, discovering inspirational tales from healthcare providers that have helped hundreds of their co-workers unleash leadership potential in their own work. Those of us working on this project have been profoundly affected by the stories we’ve been privileged to help tell, and feedback from the staff of Columbus Regional Health has outshined all our expectations.</p>
                                       <p>CONFIGURATION & DOCUMENTATION: A social network of any size needs plans in place to efficiently manage user privileges, new user additions, lost credentials and, unfortunately, increasingly sophisticated hacker attacks; and HIPAA or PCI compliance adds a new level of complexity. I've learned when to ask the right questions, and have experience configuring complex IT and can interface with existing IT assets, or launch stand-alone solutions, depending on your needs.</p>

<p>MANAGED WORDPRESS HOSTING & USER EXPERIENCE (UX/UI) DESIGN: In tandem with Managed WordPress Hosting security specialists, I created a focused user experience within a secure, easily accessible WordPress installation. By building the powerful transactional email service Mandrill by MailChimp into the site itself, user management, newsletters and social network updates all flow into a central analytics that tell Columbus’ management who, how, when and where employees are benefiting from Simply Better Leadership network. </p>

                                        <p>ROLE: Project Manager & Programmer</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Imagine your entire business is dependent on an antiquated piece of software and no one knows how it works. This is right where I stepped in when new owners of Santa Cruz Local Foods asked me to help reboot their farm-to-table online grocery store. After taking enough time to research the code structure and user experience, I was able to elevate the look and feel of the website into what the graphic designer envisioned, including a completely new navigation structure that sorts and displays products in a more intuitive way. Orders are up and several customers have even taken the time to write in on how much they enjoy the new site. </p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: The original website launched over 6 years ago but was never finished. It was based on deprecated and unwieldly code that had to be re-structured.</p>

                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Gray Line of San Francisco is a venerable brand, one that has shared their love for 'The City' for 25 years. By mapping out their customer's journey, I identified the Golden Gate Bridge as the deal-maker in the decision making process of every stakeholder interviewed.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: By interviewing customers and employees at every level of the business to determine where their old website was failing them, I was able to conduct a content audit, design a user experience that shortened the sales funnel and considerably improved online sales.</p>

                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Phillip Dell is one of the most inspirational people I've ever met, a talented chef with an amazing story who recently won his episode of <cite>Chopped!</cite> on the Food Network. He considers his service to others as a god-given calling so we designed a new logo incorporating that international symbol of hospitality, the pineapple. The site also shows off his culinary artistry throughout, with series of background images visible everywhere through transparency layers.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: Chef Dell is much more than a caterer, so to be effective the site needs to generate leads for that apsect of his business and tell the story of his media appearances, motivational speaking, teen education programs, nutrition counseling and retail products as well.</p>

                                        <p>ROLE: Project Manager, Inbound Marketing Strategist</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Autoresponders, responsive design and tons of fun promos made all the difference in the world when I relaunched the email club for beloved bay-area restaurant chain Erik's DeliCafe's 40th anniversary. I came up with a way to reward their most loyal customers, attract a whole new generation of millennials by giving away 40 Years of free sandwiches and partnered with area nonprofits to help get the word out using MailChimp's ability to target custom segments with "the right message at the right time."</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: We needed to transition the client away from their sub-par email marketing provider and introduce the new campaign to long term employees and franchisees without sacrificing customer service expectations.</p>
