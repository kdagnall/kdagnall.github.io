                                        <p>ROLE: Designer & Publicist</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: <em>Terroir</em> attempts to describe the complex influences climate, geology and geography exert on wines made in a particular region. Berryessa Gap Vineyards needed a packaging update as bright as their award-winning wines that illustrated this philosophy. The Plein Aire painting of the Berryessa Gap beautifully illustrates the location of their first vineyard and namesake, which forms the border between Napa and Yolo Counties.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: Creating labels for every shape & size of wine bottle involved a lot of measuring and a healthy amount of experimentation to discover their optimal placement and layout.</p>

                                        <p>ROLE: Designer & Publicist</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: The agrestic town of Winters, California overflows with Tempranillo each year during this three day food, wine and music festival.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: Photography or digital resources from previous Temp Fests were hard to come by, so it was neccessary to create an illustration. The abstract shapes of a wine bottle and classic guitar provide a framework for the text and visually communicate the Spanish theme.</p>

                                        <p>BACKGROUND:BACKGROUND: The Candlelight Inn is a very special Bed & Breakfast located in the turn-of-the-century home of Napa Valley's first postmaster general. After uncovering some of the original blueprints, I reverse-scanned them to create this postmark inspired logo.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: To tie the spectacular Tudor-style architecture of this Napa Valley landmark into the logo and website design, I photographed and then vectorized ornamental details from the interior.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>ROLE: Chief Developer</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Nobody does business exactly like you do. Your competition might offer some of the same stuff, but your company was built on specific values that you strive to communicate to customers and team members every day. How do you communicate these core values, so your business stays healthy, across an organization employing thousands?</p>
                                        <p>THE IDEA: In 2014, Columbus Regional Health decided to step up their game and make sure that every employee of their hospitals understood the core values that enabled their growth into West Georgia’s largest health care provider. In a proactive move, they started a conversation about the best way to launch an internal social networking website where each employee could deepen their understanding of what it means to be a leader. That’s how the “Simply Better Leadership” network was born...</p>
                                        <p>THE SOLUTION: At the heart of Simply Better Leadership are Columbus’ core values: Attitude, Commitment, Enthusiasm, Innovation & Teamwork, “ACE-IT” for short. On the website, their entire staff has access to an individual profile with book groups & discussion topics covering the Competencies, Management Skills and Behaviors an ACE-IT leader exhibits.</p>
                                        <p>We identified and customized the BuddyPress plugin for WordPress as the ultimate social networking solution for sparking dialogue and managing internal communications in a safe, HIPAA-compliant environment. Once the site was launched, Content Creators went to work interviewing Columbus’ employees, discovering inspirational tales from healthcare providers that have helped hundreds of their co-workers unleash leadership potential in their own work. Those of us working on this project have been profoundly affected by the stories we’ve been privileged to help tell, and feedback from the staff of Columbus Regional Health has outshined all our expectations.</p>
                                       <p>CONFIGURATION & DOCUMENTATION: A social network of any size needs plans in place to efficiently manage user privileges, new user additions, lost credentials and, unfortunately, increasingly sophisticated hacker attacks; and HIPAA or PCI compliance adds a new level of complexity. I've learned when to ask the right questions, and have experience configuring complex IT and can interface with existing IT assets, or launch stand-alone solutions, depending on your needs.</p>

<p>MANAGED WORDPRESS HOSTING & USER EXPERIENCE (UX/UI) DESIGN: In tandem with Managed WordPress Hosting security specialists, I created a focused user experience within a secure, easily accessible WordPress installation. By building the powerful transactional email service Mandrill by MailChimp into the site itself, user management, newsletters and social network updates all flow into a central analytics that tell Columbus’ management who, how, when and where employees are benefiting from Simply Better Leadership network. </p>

                                        <p>ROLE: Project Manager & Programmer</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Imagine your entire business is dependent on an antiquated piece of software and no one knows how it works. This is right where I stepped in when new owners of Santa Cruz Local Foods asked me to help reboot their farm-to-table online grocery store. After taking enough time to research the code structure and user experience, I was able to elevate the look and feel of the website into what the graphic designer envisioned, including a completely new navigation structure that sorts and displays products in a more intuitive way. Orders are up and several customers have even taken the time to write in on how much they enjoy the new site. </p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: The original website launched over 6 years ago but was never finished. It was based on deprecated and unwieldly code that had to be re-structured.</p>

By mapping out their customer's journey, I identified the Golden Gate Bridge as the deal-maker in the decision making process of every stakeholder interviewed.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: By interviewing customers and employees at every level of the business to determine where their old website was failing them, I was able to conduct a content audit, design a user experience that shortened the sales funnel and considerably improved online sales.</p>

                                        <p>ROLE: Programmer & Graphic Designer</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Phillip Dell is one of the most inspirational people I've ever met, a talented chef with an amazing story who recently won his episode of <cite>Chopped!</cite> on the Food Network. He considers his service to others as a god-given calling so we designed a new logo incorporating that international symbol of hospitality, the pineapple. The site also shows off his culinary artistry throughout, with series of background images visible everywhere through transparency layers.</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: Chef Dell is much more than a caterer, so to be effective the site needs to generate leads for that apsect of his business and tell the story of his media appearances, motivational speaking, teen education programs, nutrition counseling and retail products as well.</p>

                                        <p>ROLE: Project Manager, Campaign Strategist</p>
                                        <p>BACKGROUND: Autoresponders, responsive design and tons of fun promos made all the difference in the world when I relaunched the email club for beloved bay-area restaurant chain Erik's DeliCafe's 40th anniversary. I came up with a way to reward their most loyal customers, attract a whole new generation of millennials by giving away 40 Years of free sandwiches and partnered with area nonprofits to help get the word out using MailChimp's ability to target custom segments with "the right message at the right time."</p>
                                        <p>CHALLENGE: We needed to transition the client away from their sub-par email marketing provider and introduce the new campaign to long term employees and franchisees without sacrificing customer service expectations.</p>
